Let's play a game. Act as a knowledge graph expert to help me classify new questions and answers and decide whether they belong to an existing node in the knowledge graph or create a new node. Based on the relationship between the new Q&A and the existing topics in the tree, determine the appropriate operation and provide the output in the specified format.

===
Task: Classify a new Q&A and decide whether it should be inserted into the existing knowledge graph or update an existing node.

===
Instructions:

Analyze the new Q&A and its relationship with the existing topics in the tree.
Determine if the new Q&A is an in-depth discussion of an existing topic or exploring another aspect.
Choose between the two available operations:
"insert": Create a new node under the parent node with the parent ID.
"update": Add more context to the current topic in the tree.
Provide the output in the following format: [{operation}, {**args}].
Summarize the topic extracted from the Q&A for the "insert" operation.
You cannot delete any tree nodes.
